This repository contains project files for my Udacity's Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree program.

## Projects

### Navigation
>[Navigation](https://github.com/nikhilt1998/Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-Nanodegree/tree/master/Navigation)

For this project, we train an agent to navigate and collect bananas in a large, square world using Deep Q-Network (DQN).

### Continuous Control
>[Continuous Control](https://github.com/nikhilt1998/Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-Nanodegree/tree/master/Continuous_Control)

For this project, we train a double-jointed arm agent to follow a target location using Deep Distributed Policy
Gradient (DDPG).

### Collaboration and Competition
>[Collaboration and Competition](https://github.com/nikhilt1998/Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-Nanodegree/tree/master/Collaboration_nd_Competition)

For this project, we train a pair of agents to play tennis using DDPG with shared replay buffer.
