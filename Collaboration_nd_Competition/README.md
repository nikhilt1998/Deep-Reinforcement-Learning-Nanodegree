# Project : Collaboration and Competition 

## Description 
For this project, we train a pair of agents to play tennis.

## Problem Statement 
A reward of +0.1 is provided for each step that one of the two agent hits the ball over the net.
A reward of -0.01 is provided an agent lets a nall hit the ground or hits the ball out of bounds.
Thus, the goal of each agent is to keep the ball in play.

The observation space consists of 24 variables corresponding to the position and velocity of the ball and racket. Each agent receives its own, local observation. Two continuous actions are available, corresponding to movement toward (or away from) the net, and jumping.

The task is episodic. In order to solve
the environment, one of the agent must get an average score of +0.5 over 100 consecutive
episodes.

## Files 
- `Tennis.ipynb`: Notebook used to control and train the agent 
- `DDPGAgents.py`: Create an DDPGAgents class that interacts with and learns from the environment 
- `ReplayBuffer.py`: Replay Buffer class to store the experiences
- `OUNoise.py`: Ornstein Uhlenbeck noise for the actor to improve exploration
- `model.py`: Actor and Critic classes  
- `config.json`: Configuration file to store variables and paths
- `utils.py`: Helper functions 
- `report.pdf`: Technical report

## Dependencies
To be able to run this code, you will need an environment with Python 3 and 
the dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file so that you can install them
using the following command: 
```
pip install requirements.txt
``` 

Furthermore, you need to download the environment from one of the links below. You need only to select
the environment that matches your operating system:
